# Secure-AES-LSB-Image-Steganography
Securely embed AES-encrypted messages into grayscale images using LSB steganography. This toolkit analyzes image quality impact with PSNR and SSIM metrics across varying payloads. Supports blind extraction without original image, providing a modular, extensible framework for secure covert communication and research.
